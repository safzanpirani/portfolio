			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm an AI and machine learning enthusiast with a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience in developing innovative solutions. My passion lies in building intelligent systems that can transform industries and improve user experiences. With a diverse skill set in various programming languages and frameworks, I can quickly adapt to new technologies and deliver high-quality, impactful results.</p>
			<p>I have successfully contributed to projects involving generative AI and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) LLM systems. My work has focused on developing and fine-tuning AI models to enhance performance and accuracy, particularly in real-world applications. I'm dedicated to continuously learning and growing as a developer, staying current with the latest advancements in AI and related technologies.</p>
			<p>In my free time, I enjoy contributing to gaming, working on my art, and exploring new ways to use AI to allow for easier self-expression through art. I'm very much excited to further my expertise in generative AI, machine learning, and other modern technologies, driving innovation and making meaningful contributions to the field.</p>

				<h2>Final Year Major Project</h2>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/safzanpirani/local-rag">Offline, Open-Source RAG</a></p>
				<p>Retrieve, Augment, and Generate with Open-Source Large Language Models</p>
				<p>This project provides a self-contained, offline platform for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). With this project, you can ingesting files and leverage the power of LLMs without relying on third-party services or exposing sensitive data.</p>
				<p>Key Features:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Offline Embeddings & LLMs Support: No need for OpenAI or other external services. Our platform uses open-source LLMs, ensuring your data stays within your network.</li>
					<li>Support for Multiple Sources: Ingest files from various sources, including:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Local Files: Upload and process files from your local machine.</li>
						<li>GitHub Repos: Ingest files from GitHub repositories.</li>
						<li>Websites: Retrieve and process web pages.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Streaming Responses: Enjoy real-time responses from the model, enabling a more interactive and conversational experience.</li>
					<li>Conversational Memory: The model maintains context and understanding throughout conversations, allowing for more coherent and relevant responses.</li>
					<li>Chat Export: Export conversations for further analysis or review.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Benefits:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Maintain data confidentiality: By keeping data within your network, you minimize the risk of data breaches and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.</li>
					<li>Cost-effective: No subscription fees or usage charges. Run the model on your own hardware or cloud infrastructure.</li>
					<li>Flexibility: Easily integrate with your existing infrastructure and workflows.</li>
				</ul>
