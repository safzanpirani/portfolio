			<h2>about me</h2>
			<p>i'm an ai and machine learning enthusiast with a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience in developing innovative solutions. my passion lies in building intelligent systems that can transform industries and improve user experiences. with a diverse skill set in various programming languages and frameworks, i can quickly adapt to new technologies and deliver high-quality, impactful results.</p>
			<p>i have successfully contributed to projects involving generative ai and retrieval-augmented generation (rag) llm systems. my work has focused on developing and fine-tuning ai models to enhance performance and accuracy, particularly in real-world applications. i'm dedicated to continuously learning and growing as a developer, staying current with the latest advancements in ai and related technologies.</p>
			<p>in my free time, i enjoy contributing to gaming, working on my art, and exploring new ways to use ai to allow for easier self-expression through art. </p>
            <p>i'm very much excited to further my expertise in generative ai, machine learning, and other modern technologies, driving innovation and making meaningful contributions to the field.</p>

				<h2>final year mini project</h2>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/safzanpirani/licenseminispec">license plate detection and recognition using YOLOv8 and easyOCR</a></p>
                <br>
				<p>this project is a part of our final year mini project for computer science engineering. the goal of this project is to design and develop a system that can detect and recognize license plates in videos using yolov8 and easyocr.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>license plate detection: using YOLOv8, a real-time object detection system, to detect license plates in videos.</li>
                  <li>license plate recognition: Using easyOCR, an optical character recognition system, to recognize the text in the detected license plates.</li>
                </ul>

				<h2>final year major project</h2>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/safzanpirani/local-rag">offline, open-source rag</a></p>
                <br>
				<p>retrieve, augment, and generate with open-source large language models</p>
				<p>this project provides a self-contained, offline platform for retrieval augmented generation (rag) using open-source large language models (llms). with this project, you can ingesting files and leverage the power of llms without relying on third-party services or exposing sensitive data.</p>
				<p>key features:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>offline embeddings & llms support: no need for openai or other external services. our platform uses open-source llms, ensuring your data stays within your network.</li>
					<li>support for multiple sources: ingest files from various sources, including:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>local files: upload and process files from your local machine.</li>
						<li>github repos: ingest files from github repositories.</li>
						<li>websites: retrieve and process web pages.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>streaming responses: enjoy real-time responses from the model, enabling a more interactive and conversational experience.</li>
					<li>conversational memory: the model maintains context and understanding throughout conversations, allowing for more coherent and relevant responses.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>maintain data confidentiality: by keeping data within your network, you minimize the risk of data breaches and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.</li>
                    <li>cost-effective: no subscription fees or usage charges. run the model on your own hardware or cloud infrastructure.</li>
                    <li>flexibility: easily integrate with your existing infrastructure and workflows.</li>
                </ul>
